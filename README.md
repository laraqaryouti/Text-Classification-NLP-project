## Text Classification for News Articles

For my natural language processing course, I developed a text classification project aimed at categorizing news articles into three distinct categories: sports, political, and historical. The classification is performed for both English and Arabic texts.

## Dataset:
The dataset comprises 48 news articles, evenly distributed between English and Arabic, with 24 articles in each language.

## Methodology:
I employed Logistic Regression as the classification algorithm, leveraging its effectiveness in handling text-based data. The model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 80%, showcasing its proficiency in discerning between sports, political, and historical content.

This project serves as a practical application of natural language processing techniques, which shows their utility in real-world scenarios.
